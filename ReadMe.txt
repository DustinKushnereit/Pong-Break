James Potvin And Dustin Kushnereit

This games is a new retrospective on the classic pong with a little bit of brickbreaker sneaking into
the game. Each player has a set of 18 bricks blocking their "goal". If the ball makes its' way through
a players bricks and into their goal, that player will lose a life. If a player loses all their lives,
the other player is victorious.

How to play
Player one moves up with the "W" key and down with the "S" key.
Player two moves up with the "Up Arrow" key and down with the "Down Arrow" key.
Players hit the ball with their individual blocks to knock the ball back at their opponent.

Unique features/parts of the game.
If you press "M", you will delete all the blocks.
If you press "R", you will revive all the blocks.
If you press "P", you can force start the game without connecting to another client.
The ball speeds up with each successive bouncs off of a block or paddle. The ball's speed is reset
